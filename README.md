# IGT_assignment

Questions to solve:
1.  Which carrier performs better?
2.  When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
3.  Do older planes suffer more delays?
4.  Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?
5. 	Create a model to predict flight delays
6. 	How well does weather predict plane delays?
