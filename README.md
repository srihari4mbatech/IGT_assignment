# IGT_assignment

Questions to solve:
* 	Which carrier performs better? 
* 	When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
* 	Do older planes suffer more delays?
* 	Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?
* 	Create a model to predict flight delays
* 	How well does weather predict plane delays?
